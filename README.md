# A Pokemon search engine

(Brutally in Alpha)

### For searching very specific traits in a desired Pokemon.

Made for self-learning purposes.

Right now in an extremely alpha stage, it can just search Pokemon by type.

## To Do :

### (First priority):

- Adding logic to handle failed fetches
- Adding a back button to Pokemon pages
- More criteria available for searching overall

### (Very important):

- Adding a back button and a Enter key event to modals (it's up now only to pressing ESC or clicking "done" right now)
- Fixing a bug about modals don't resetting after setting up once
- Adding a trigger for pressing enter while focusing the combobox
- Adding Pokemon species as suggestions in the combobox

### (Still relevant):

- Adding more information in Pokemon pages
- Adding a dark mode
- Adding undo functionality for deleting criteria in combobox
- Adding more screen reading logic to Pokemon Pages
- Adding criteria in the suggestions in the combobox for screen readers
- Refining Pokemon pages for mobiles (didn't made it in figma yet)
- Fixing certain points for tablets and mobiles in searches
- Make breakpoints follow Material UI guidelines (they are the tailwind's default)

### (Low priority):

- Make shadow boxes follow Material UI guidelines
- Make pokemon artwork interactable
- Refining modal transitions
- Overall just add some flavor with transitions
