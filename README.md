A Pokemon search engine, for searching very specific traits in a desired Pokemon.
Made for self-learning purposes.

Right now in an extremely alpha stage, it can just search Pokemon by type.

To Do :

(First priority):

- Adding logic to handle failed fetches
- Adding a back button to Pokemon pages
- More criteria available for searching overall

(Very important):

- Adding a back button and a Enter key event to modals (it's up only to key shortcuts or clicking "done" right now)
- Adding a trigger for pressing enter while focusing the combobox
- Adding Pokemon species as suggestions in the combobox

(Still relevant):

- More information in Pokemon pages
- Adding a dark mode
- Fixing a bug about modals don't resetting after setting up once
- Adding undo functionality for deleting criteria in combobox
- Adding more screen reading logic to Pokemon Pages
- Adding criteria in the suggestions in the combobox for screen readers
- Refining Pokemonn pages for mobiles (didn't made it in figma yet)
- Fixing certain points for tablets and mobiles in searches
- Make breakpoints follow material ui guidelines (they are the tailwind's default)

(Low priority):

- Make shadow boxes follow material ui guidelines
- Make pokemon artwork interactable
- Refining modal transitions are whatever
- Overall just add some flavor with transitions
